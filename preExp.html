        Thank you for participating in our study about credibility judgments. We conduct this study within the class "Informationverhalten verstehen".

        In the following, you will get 6 pages with 8 results each and your task is to make an assumption about the credibility of the websites, which are represented by a snippet.
        This is followed by a short post-questionnaire where you have to provide some demographic information and questions regarding the given search results.
        The whole study takes approximately XX minutes to complete.
