        Thank you for participating in our study about credibility judgments!
        <br>
        We conduct this study within the class "Informationverhalten verstehen".
        <br><br>
        In the following, you will get 6 pages with 8 results each and your task is
        <br>
        to make an assumption about the credibility of the websites, which are represented by a snippet.
        <br><br>
        This is followed by a short post-questionnaire where you have to provide some demographic information
        <br>
        and questions regarding the given search results.
        <br><br>
        The whole study takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.
        <br><br>
        If you are a Medieninformatik- or Informationswissenschaft-Student at the University of Regensburg,
        <br>
        you can get 0.5 VP-hours for this. To receive them, just enter your email and id at the end of the questionary.
        <br><br>
        Your data is only seen by the study conductors and supervisors and is later analyzed in a paper.
        <br>
        Records are automatically deleted after the end of the research.
